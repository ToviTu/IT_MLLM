		"Context": "About 80% of undergraduates and 20% of graduate students live on campus. The majority of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes on campus, while all on-campus undergraduates live in one of the 29 residence halls. Because of the religious affiliation of the university, all residence halls are single-sex, with 15 male dorms and 14 female dorms. The university maintains a visiting policy (known as parietal hours) for those students who live in dormitories, specifying times when members of the opposite sex are allowed to visit other students' dorm rooms; however, all residence halls have 24-hour social spaces for students regardless of gender. Many residence halls have at least one nun and/or priest as a resident. There are no traditional social fraternities or sororities at the university, but a majority of students live in the same residence hall for all four years.

		"Context": "At about the same time, the word \"humanism\" as a philosophy centred on humankind (as opposed to institutionalised religion) was also being used in Germany by the so-called Left Hegelians, Arnold Ruge, and Karl Marx, who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the repressive German government. There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms: philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists.",
		"Question": "Where did the learned believers place their focus?",
		"Rationale": " The context discusses the multifaceted interpretations and applications of humanism, particularly distinguishing between philanthropic humanists and scholarly humanists. Scholarly humanists, as described, prioritize the \"linguistic and cultural disciplines\" necessary for comprehending and interpreting the works of Greek philosophers and Renaissance figures, who are regarded as their philosophical and historical antecedents. This focus is rooted in a deep engagement with the texts, languages, and cultural contexts that shaped these influential thinkers and artists. Therefore, when referring to \"learned believers\" in this context, it points to scholarly humanists who center their attention on the academic and disciplined study of language and culture as tools to understand human-centered philosophy and critical thinking traditions. This approach underlines the intellectual tradition of studying and interpreting the humanistic elements of historical texts and contributions within the broader scope of human-centered studies.",
		"Answer": "linguistic and cultural disciplines"

		"Context": "During the Eocene (56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago), the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.",
		"Question": "Around how many years ago is the current ice age pattern believed to have begun?",
		"Rationale": "The context outlines the geological and climatic changes that occurred during the Eocene epoch, highlighting the significant shifts in continental positions and ocean currents, and their impact on global temperatures. A key event described is the separation of Australia from Antarctica, which altered ocean currents, leading to the cooling of the Antarctic region. This cooling initiated a pattern of ice ages, a cyclical phenomenon characterized by the expansion of continental ice sheets, polar ice, and alpine glaciers. According to the provided information, this pattern of ice ages is believed to have begun approximately 40 million years ago, marking a pivotal shift in Earth's climatic history and leading to the colder global climate conditions that have occurred periodically up to the present day.",

		"Context": "Complex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as Immunoassays. Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.",
		"Question": "What are immunoassays?",
		"Rationale": " Immunoassays are described in the context as advanced serological techniques that have evolved to utilize the fundamental principle of antibody-antigen interaction. This interaction is used to generate a detectable signal, which can be electromagnetic or particle radiation-based, allowing for the quantification of target antigens. These assays are instrumental in diagnosing infectious diseases by detecting or measuring either antigens from infectious agents or proteins produced by an organism in response to infection. The context further illustrates the versatility of immunoassays through examples, showing how one immunoassay might identify a virus's surface protein, while another could measure the antibodies an organism's immune system generates against the virus. Therefore, describing immunoassays as \"Complex serological techniques\" succinctly captures their essence and the sophisticated methodology they represent in the field of immunology and diagnostics.",
		"Answer": "Complex serological techniques"
