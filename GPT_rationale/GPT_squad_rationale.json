		"Context": "At about the same time, the word \"humanism\" as a philosophy centred on humankind (as opposed to institutionalised religion) was also being used in Germany by the so-called Left Hegelians, Arnold Ruge, and Karl Marx, who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the repressive German government. There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms: philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists.",
		"Question": "Where did the learned believers place their focus?",
		"Rationale": "The query asks about the primary focus of \"learned believers,\" referring specifically to a group within the context of humanism as discussed in the provided information. It seeks to identify what these individuals prioritize in their scholarly pursuits. The context provided discusses different interpretations and focuses of humanism, distinguishing between philanthropic humanists and scholarly humanists.

		"Context": "During the Eocene (56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago), the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.",
		"Question": "Around how many years ago is the current ice age pattern believed to have begun?",
		"Rationale": "The question inquires about the onset of the current pattern of ice ages, specifically seeking to establish a timeline based on geological events described in the provided context. The context details the geological and climatic changes during the Eocene epoch, particularly focusing on the separation of Australia from Antarctica and the resultant changes in ocean currents and global temperatures, which eventually led to the development of the present pattern of ice ages. Initially, Australia and Antarctica were connected, which allowed warm equatorial currents to mix with colder Antarctic waters. This mixture helped distribute heat globally, maintaining higher global temperatures. As Australia drifted away from Antarctica around 45 million years ago (Ma), this separation altered ocean currents, leading to the development of a cold water channel between the two continents. The isolation and the formation of the cold water channel contributed to significant cooling in the Antarctic region, which intensified global cooling. The text explicitly states that the pattern of ice ages we recognize today began around 40 million years ago, coinciding with these climatic shifts and the increased presence of ice. The answer to when the current ice age pattern began is accurately given as 40 million years ago. This conclusion is directly supported by the context's description of significant geological events and their climatic consequences, which marked the start of the current ice age pattern.",

		"Context": "Complex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as Immunoassays. Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.",
		"Question": "What are immunoassays?",
		"Rationale": "The query asks for a definition or description of what immunoassays are, referring to their application and function in a scientific or medical context.
